    <p>You have my heart. We will never be worlds apart, maybe in magasine you will be always my star. Baby 'cause in the dark. You
       can't see shiny cars.

       If I woke up without you I don't know what I will do. Thought I could be single for ever till I met you. Usually don't be fallen be fallen
       fallen first, you got a way of keepin' me coming back to back. I just found out the only reason that you lovin' me was to get back at my ex
       lover but before you leave.
    </p>

      Club isn't the best place to find a lover so the bar is where is where I go. Me and my friends at the table doing shots
      drinking fasts and we talk slow. Come over me start up conversation with just me and trust I give it chance......
