    <p>Baby I hope that this ain't karma cause I get around. You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down. Usaully don't be fallen be fallen fallen first. You got a way of keeping me coming back to back. Every night and every day I try to make you stay, but your savage love did someboyd did someboydy brake your heart lookin' like an angel but Your savage love when you kiss me I know you don't give two fucks. But I still want that savagelove.</p>
